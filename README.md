## garbage collage
make colalges with other people's (digital) trash

rough collage goals...
- cut things out that aren't rectangular
- drag things from your "table" (the bottom half) to the "assembly" canvas in the top half of the screen where you can assemble your composition - and it supports
- resizing
- relayering
- exporting as an image
- user gallery of "finished" collage compositions
- trash trash (ability to drag things to the bottom right to delete them lol)
- add more "magazines" and make their contents random-er
- make more "kinds" of magazines  and the ability to change which kind something is. which would just aesthetically change how it's displayed. (newspapers, stacks of paper, cards)
- actually let other people upload their own trash (?!)
  - thought, maybe just let people submit trash to a google form or something? and then manually update the database, so the trash collection is curated and not full of user submitted spam or worse
- a reach goal: instead of showing you all the available trash collections. when you want a new "magazine" you have to click a button that says "dig through the trash" and a little animation of a raccoon in the garbage comes up or something. and you have to wait a couple seconds. then there's a New item Get! type screen like "YOU FOUND: *frames from a video shm accidentally took in may 2025*" and then you may use that as a collection
